# Revature Music Store

This project started with Max Chervinsky as his P0 at Revature. It was then built on by the Amplifier - The Noise team for P1. Below is a step-by-step guide on how to deploy this metadata to your trailhaed playground org.

## Set up guide

- Navigate to new folder
- git clone "https://github.com/maxcherv/Amplifire.git"
- Authorize the new org
    - This may require a custom URL unless you change the JSON for configuration
- Deploy SiteSamples (it is a static resource)
- Deploy package.xml

Note that SiteSamples needs to be deployed before the rest of the org.
